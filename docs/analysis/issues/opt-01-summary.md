title: '[OPT-01] Replace Custom Workflow with WorkflowBuilder Pattern'
labels: ['enhancement', 'optimization', 'agent-framework', 'high-priority']
---

## Priority Level
ðŸ”¥ **High Priority** - Architectural Improvement

## Overview
Replace the custom `MultiAgentWorkflow` class with the official Microsoft Agent Framework's `WorkflowBuilder` pattern for graph-based orchestration. This will provide native framework features like automatic state management, cycle detection, and streaming support.

## Current State

### Implementation
- Custom `MultiAgentWorkflow` class in `src/agenticfleet/workflows/multi_agent.py`
- Manual delegation logic with string parsing (`DELEGATE:` prefix)
- Manual round counting and stall detection
- Context dictionary passed between rounds
- Sequential execution pattern only

### Limitations
1. **No Graph Validation**: Cannot detect cycles or invalid transitions before execution
2. **Manual State Management**: Context dict is error-prone and untyped
3. **No Streaming**: Cannot stream intermediate results to users
4. **Limited Flexibility**: Hard to add conditional branching or parallel execution
5. **No Visualization**: Cannot generate visual workflow graphs
6. **Reinventing the Wheel**: Duplicating framework functionality

## Proposed Implementation

See full implementation details in the issue document.

## Benefits
- âœ… Native graph validation with cycle detection
- âœ… Automatic state management with type safety
- âœ… Real-time event streaming
- âœ… Better error handling and recovery
- âœ… Easier to maintain and extend
- âœ… Future-proof with framework updates

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create new workflow_builder.py module
- [ ] Implement basic WorkflowBuilder with sequential edges
- [ ] Add orchestrator decision logic to edge conditions
- [ ] Migrate existing functionality
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests
- [ ] Update documentation

## Estimated Effort
ðŸ”¨ **Medium** (2-3 weeks)

## Success Criteria
- All existing functionality works with new implementation
- No performance regression
- 100% test coverage
- Complete documentation

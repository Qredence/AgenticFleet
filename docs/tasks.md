## [Planned] Establish .cursor Directory and Project Rules
- Create a `.cursor` directory at the project root for rules and configuration.
- Draft and maintain a `rules.md` file inside `.cursor` to define coding standards, commit conventions, branching, PR/review process, and task management guidelines.
- Ensure all rules are actionable and up to date with current workflow.
- Update this `tasks.md` as changes are made.

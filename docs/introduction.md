## Concept

AgenticFleet is built upon the concept of autonomous agents â€“ intelligent software entities capable of independent action and decision-making. These agents can interact with each other, access external resources, and perform tasks based on their programming and the information they receive. The framework provides the infrastructure for managing these agents as a "fleet," allowing for scalability and efficient resource utilization.

Key concepts include:

*   **Agent-Based Architecture:** AgenticFleet utilizes a modular, agent-based architecture, making it easy to customize and extend.
*   **Fleet Management:** The framework provides tools for managing large numbers of agents, including deployment, monitoring, and scaling.
*   **Tool Integration:** Agents can be equipped with tools to perform specific tasks, such as web scraping, data analysis, or code generation. AgenticFleet provides a framework for integrating both built-in and custom tools.
*   **Collaboration:** Agents can collaborate with each other to solve complex problems, leveraging the strengths of different agent types.
*   **Scalability:** AgenticFleet is designed to scale to handle large workloads and complex tasks.
*   **Flexibility:** The framework can be adapted to a wide range of use cases and integrated with various external systems.

# API Reference

AgenticFleet currently leverages the [Microsoft Autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) framework for its core agent functionality. Therefore, the primary API reference for agent creation, management, and interaction is the Autogen documentation:

*   **Autogen Documentation:** [https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)
*   **Autogen API Reference:** Refer to the Autogen documentation for details on classes, methods, and data structures.
*   **Autogen Examples:** [https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/samples](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/samples)

## AgenticFleet-Specific APIs

AgenticFleet provides a command-line interface (CLI) for starting the server and managing the system. The CLI is documented in the [Usage Guide](./usage-guide.md).

**Future Enhancements:**

AgenticFleet is under active development. Future releases will include specialized AgenticFleet agents with their own APIs. This section of the documentation will be updated as these features become available.

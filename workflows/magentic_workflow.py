Magentic Workflow Implementation

This module implements the Magentic workflow pattern for coordinating multiple
specialized agents in the AgenticFleet system. The workflow uses Microsoft's
Agent Framework to orchestrate agent interactions and manage task delegation.

The Magentic Workflow:
- Registers multiple specialized agents as participants
- Manages communication and coordination between agents
- Handles event streaming for observability
- Enforces execution limits (max rounds, stalls, resets)
- Provides a unified interface for task execution

Architecture:
    User Request â†’ Orchestrator â†’ Specialized Agents â†’ Synthesized Response
                        â†“
                   [Researcher, Coder, Analyst]

Key Features:
- Dynamic agent delegation based on task requirements
- Event-driven architecture for real-time monitoring
- Automatic workflow management (retry, reset, termination)
- Thread-safe conversation context management

Usage:
    from workflows.magentic_workflow import create_magentic_workflow

    workflow = create_magentic_workflow()
    result = await workflow.run("Your task here")

def create_magentic_workflow():
    """
    Create the Magentic workflow with all specialized agents.

    This function builds a complete multi-agent workflow following the
    Microsoft Agent Framework's Magentic pattern. It:

    1. Imports all agent factory functions
    2. Creates instances of all specialized agents
    3. Configures the MagenticBuilder with:
       - Agent participants (orchestrator, researcher, coder, analyst)
       - Event handlers for observability
       - Standard manager with execution limits
    4. Returns the built workflow ready for execution

    The workflow uses stable identifiers for participants, which is crucial
    for features like checkpointing and conversation persistence.

    Returns:
        MagenticWorkflow: Configured workflow ready to execute tasks

    Raises:
        ValueError: If configuration is invalid or agents fail to initialize

    Example:
        >>> workflow = create_magentic_workflow()
        >>> result = await workflow.run("Research Python ML libraries")
        >>> print(result)
